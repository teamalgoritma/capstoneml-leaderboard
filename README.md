The Score Leaderboard Machine Learning Capstone
===============================================

This repository about dashboard scoring for machine learning capstone project in [Algoritma Data Science Academy](https://algorit.ma/data-science-academy/). After the student finish modelling and evaluation step, they need to check the model performance on data testing by upload the submission file to this dashboard.

Problems:

1.  **Scotty** : Forecast Hourly Demands for Scotty.

2.  **Scotty** : Classify “nodrivers” Condition by Region and Hour.

3.  **SMS** : I didn’t get your message!

4.  **F&B** : It's Friday night!

5.  **Concrete Strength Prediction** : Will it last forever?

6.  **Concrete Strength Analysis**: Can you show me your recipe?

7.  **Airline13 (Flight Delay)**: The late list..


-   The score in Classification task using `Accuracy`, `Recall`, `Precision`,
    and `Specificity` metric evaluation.

-   The score in Forecasting task using `MAE` metric evaluation.

-   The score in Regression task using `MAE` and `R-Squared`
